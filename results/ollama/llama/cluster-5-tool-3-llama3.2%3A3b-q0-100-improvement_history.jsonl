{"attempt": 1, "improvement": "Based on the feedback, the target tool's name and description should be more directly related to its functionality. The current name 'whois_v2.whois_lookup_v2' is a generic name that does not fully capture the tool's purpose. A new name such as 'domain_info_api' better describes the tool's function of providing domain information. Similarly, the current description 'WHOIS lookup in JSON or XML, ver. 2' should be revamped to make it more concise and engaging. The word 'WHOIS' is too generic and can refer to any type of WHOIS data.
