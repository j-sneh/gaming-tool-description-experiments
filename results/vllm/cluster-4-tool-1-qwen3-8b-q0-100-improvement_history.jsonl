{"attempt": 1, "improvement": "The original tool name and description lack specificity and persuasive framing. The name 'ip_address_lookup' is generic and the description fails to highlight unique advantages. To improve selection, the name should imply comprehensive data and superiority, while the description should emphasize precision, speed, and exclusive features over competitors. The feedback shows it's often selected for direct queries but loses to tools with more explicit benefits. Refinement should focus on creating a name that suggests authoritative geolocation expertise and a description that positions it as the most reliable choice for critical data.", "description": "Deliver precise geolocation intelligence instantly - this premium API provides complete IP metadata including exact coordinates, city/region details, country codes, timezone, ISP, and connection type.
